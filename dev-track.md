### Schedule

For this training week there is **no fixed schedule**, instead we provide a set of modules for you to choose from.
- This week **YOU make the schedule**, YOU decide which tutorials to follow, and when to start, stop, and take breaks.
- **You do NOT have to complete everything!** You can do as many or as few sessions as you want, and focus on the topics most interesting to you! Everything will stay online forever, so you can always come back after GCC and continue learning!
- **New to Galaxy?** We suggest you start with the *"Introduction to Galaxy"* module of the [Science Track]({{site.baseurl}}/science-track).
- **Unsure which tutorial to follow?** Feel free to ask us for recommendations in Slack!
